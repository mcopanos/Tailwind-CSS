# Tailwind-CSS
Website styled only using Tailwind\
This is a website of a "duped" breakfast restaurant. I was wanting to use tailwind and this was a project that helped me get used to the classes and styling.\
I enjoyed using Tailwind CSS and will reach for it on future projects. 
## Glide-JS
The glider in the website was from the Glide JS library\
I did the glider styling with Tailwind as well\
Just used Glid JS just for the functionality
